You're trying to map triples with 9 entities and 0 relations that are not in the training set. These triples will be excluded from the mapping.
In total 9 from 17535 triples were filtered out

The ConvE model should be trained with inverse triples.
This can be done by defining the TriplesFactory class with the _create_inverse_triples_ parameter set to true.
